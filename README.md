This dataset originates from the Connecticut State Library and was created by library staff as part of an effort to highlight, preserve, and make unique archival records related to the Civil War more accessible. It was published by the State of Connecticut through the open data portal, data.ct.gov, for public use. The dataset strives to bring attention to historical records that have often gone unnoticed or underappreciated, particularly those documenting the service of persons of color in the Union Army. 
Each row in the dataset represents an individual person who enlisted in the 29th Connecticut Volunteer Infantry Regiment. The dataset functions as a person-level index rather than a complete service record. Columns include identifying information transcribed from enlistment documents, such as the individual’s name, race, place of birth, and other personal or enlistment-related details as recorded at the time. Because the dataset is derived from historical archival material, the dataset reflects the limitations and conventions of nineteenth-century recordkeeping. Spelling variations, inconsistencies, and incomplete entries may be present. 
This dataset represents a specific and limited perspective: persons of color who served in a single regiment, the 29th Connecticut Volunteer Infantry Regiment. As a result, it excludes soldiers of color who served in other Connecticut units, in regiments from other states, or in non-military roles during the Civil War. It also does not include white soldiers, civilians, or individuals who supported the war effort outside of formal enlistment. Additionally, the dataset lacks information on soldiers’ outcomes, such as whether they were wounded, killed, discharged, or survived the war. This absence limits the ability of researchers to analyze experiences beyond enlistment, including the human cost of service. Despite these limitations, it provides valuable documentation of a historically marginalized group whose service has often been overlooked in traditional accounts of the Civil War.
